## Introduction

Maybe the most complex steps before and during migrations are the `Schema Conversion` and `Data Migraion` itself. This is the context for both tasks.

## Schema Conversion

* You can use `AWS DMS Schema Conversion (AWS SC) with Generative AI`.
* AWS recommends customers doing conversions from commercial database to open source databases.

## Data Migration

* The source database remains fully operational during the migration.
* The goal is minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.
