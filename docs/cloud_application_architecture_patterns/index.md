- **Domain Service**: How do you model those operations within a subdomain that do not belong to a specific Entity or Aggregate?
- **Event**: How do you represent a change in one component to be communicated to other components?
- **Event API**: How can the reactive components in an event-driven architecture know what events to expect?
- **Event Backbone**: How can reactive components receive the event they are interested in without being coupled directly to the event notifiers that generate the events?
- **Event Choreography**: When a change ocurrs in one component, how can a variable number of other components react accordingy?
- **Event Notifier**: How and when shpuld a component announce changes to other components?
- **Event Sourcing**: As an application's state changes constantly and unpredictably due to evolving conditions, how can you audit the history that created the current state?
- **Event Storming**: How do you get the stakeholders to understand and describe the elements and event arouund the domain and subdomain?
- **External Configuration**: How can I build my application once and yet be able to deploy it to multiple environments that are configured differently?
- **Extract Component**: How do you separate loosely related parts of the code in our monolith into distinct deployable units?
- **Graph Database**: How can an application most efficiently store and retrieve interrelated data entities by navitating their relationships?
- **Hairline Cracks**: How do you identify the areas within a monolith application that are candidate boundaries for microservices?
- **Interaction Model**: How do yo avoid mixing business and presentation logic inside your Client application?
- **Key-value Database**: How can an application most efficiently store and retrieve independent data entities thar are always looked up by the same key?
- **Lift and shift**: What is the simplest possible way to move an existing application to the cloud?
- **Micro Frontend**: How do you avoid creating a monolithic Single-Page application by placing too much functionality in a common front-end?
- **Microservices**: How do you architect an application as a set of interconnected modules that can be developed independently?
- **Mobile Application**: How do you provide the most optimized user experience on a mobile device and take advantage of the features that make mobile computing unique?
- **Model Around the Domain**: How can you encourage stakeholders to explain enough of the domain requirements in a way that reveals the relevant capabilities for the application you are building?
- **Modular Monolith**: How can I architect my application to make it easier to maintain anf evolve quickly?
- **New Features as Microservices**: While strangling a monolith, how do ypu avoid adding new functionality to the monolith that will later have to be modernized into microservices?
- **Pave the road**: How can we encourage teams to move to the cloud and adopt these new technologies without letting each team go in their own direction and work at cross purposes?
- **Playback testing**: How do you ensure that the new microservices architecture maintains the same functionality as the old monolithic system, especially when the amount of detailed end-to-end application knowledge of the existing application may be limited?
- **Polyglot Persistence**: How can an application store its Data Modelues in the type of database that works best for the application's data structure and how it accesses the data?
- **Polyglot Development**: What computer language(s) should be used for implementing microservices?
- **Public API**: How do you best enable third-party applications to interact programmatically with a Cloud Application?
- **Reactive Component**: How can you construct an application that can react to events?
- **Refactor the Monolith**: How can I make an existing application easier for multiple trams to maintain and able to run effectively in a multi-computer environment?
